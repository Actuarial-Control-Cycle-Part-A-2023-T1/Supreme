# STORSLYSIA SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM 
# ~ Supreme Team UNSW ~

![](Actuarial.gif)

## Executive Summary
The following report is addressed to Natalia Bowditch and Huey Caine’s task force. There is growing concern in the country of Storslysia that catastrophic weather events are becoming more prevalent. When these events occur in high-risk areas, the risk of mass permanent displacement is amplified, 
which puts a large strain on the country’s economy. Enclosed in this report are recommendations for the design of a social insurance program to mitigate financial losses arising from catastrophic climate-related displacement.
## Program Objectives
We have designed a program that minimises the cost of relocation (accounting for both voluntary relocation and involuntary displacement costs) to not exceed 10% of the country’s annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) with a high degree of certainty (1% significance level). This is achieved by 
incentivising proactive relocation from high-risk areas to low-medium risk areas before catastrophic events occur, as costs associated with proactive relocation are comparably lower than the costs associated with involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. Furthermore, 
our design encompasses suggestions for deterring individuals from living in high-risk areas. 

Table 1 lists the indication of program success:

| Metric | Reporting schedule | Indication of success|
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- |
| Metric 1: <br> Ratio of accumulated year to date (YTD) relocation costs as a point estimate to GDP as recorded YTD.  | This metric will be reported quarterly, as new figures of the country’s GDP emerge. Data from relocation costs will be collected quarterly at the same time as GDP figures. | The program is successful if metric 1 does not exceed 0.1 at year end, even if metric 2 fails. Due to the unexpected nature of these catastrophic events, if the ratio exceeds 0.1 at year end, refer to metric 2. |
|Metric 2: <br> Ratio of quarterly relocation costs as a point estimate to GDP generated in that given quarter.   | This metric will be reported quarterly, as new figures of the country’s GDP emerge. Data from relocation costs will be collected quarterly at the same time as GDP figures.| The program is successful if metric 2 does not exceed 0.1 for more than two consecutive quarters. If metric 1 exceeds 0.1, then the program will still be considered successful if metric 2 achieves a yearly average below 0.1.|
|Metric 3: <br> The accumulated annual losses from relocation with the program in place less the estimated losses without the program   |This metric will be reviewed annually. The losses without the program are estimated based on events that occurred and the estimated regional populations assuming no program incentives.|The program is successful if metric 3 is negative. That is, the program reduces annual costs incurred from mass displacement.|

## Program Design
The program encompasses the proactive and reactive relocation of citizens and permanent residents owning residential properties of Storslysia. All citizens registered in the national census will be issued with a letter stating whether they are located within a low, medium, or high-risk area: 

|   |
|---|
| Individuals from high-risk areas who wish to relocate will be prioritised over those in medium risk areas.| 
| Individuals from high-risk areas who do not seek to relocate within three months of this letter being issued will be classified as “involuntary relocators”.|

Proactive relocation areas of support will also be provided through government agencies, however many of these are external to the program. These include, but are not limited to:

|   |
|---|
| Safety and security during the displacement | 
| Access to health, nutrition, psycho-social well-being, education|
| Access to living accommodations|


<br> <ins> Deterring involuntary displacement:</ins>
<br> Consider two families that own properties valued at Ꝕ100,000. Family A are proactive relocators hence they will be able to purchase a home without having to replace any household items (40-75% of housing cost) nor will they be subjected to surges in labour and building costs (which are capped at 50% by law).  
However, Family B refuse to relocate, despite warnings of extreme weather events.  
<br> The potential costs are:

Assuming individuals rebuild new properties of the same value as the original residence, involuntary displacement costs are 1.4-2.25 times greater than proactive relocation costs. To reflect the risk of (self-imposed) increased losses, the program will provide a subsidy of up to 50% of the original value of impacted residential properties (Figure 1) in high and medium-risk areas, provided that relocation is necessary. This implies that involuntary relocators may face financial losses upwards of 90% upon rebuilding their new homes. Alternatively, should relocators choose to proactively migrate from a high to low-risk area, the program will subsidies the new property at a predetermined rate (Figure 1), which results in a much smaller financial loss to the individual; they will gain an extra benefit of 10% as well as avoiding additional costs from supply disruptions compared with involuntary relocation. Furthermore, this subsidised plan will be extended to individuals seeking to proactively relocate from medium to low-risk areas, however, the subsidised rate will only be up to 30% as the risk of being affected by a catastrophic event is lower.  
<br>
No subsidy will be awarded to individuals in low-risk areas. The difference in subsidy rates between high-risk and medium-risk residencies is also set to priorities high-risk areas, which are at far greater risk of mass displacement and incur the greatest costs to the economy. Over time, these subsidy rates will be continually monitored and reassessed based on future cost projection as well as high-risk population projections; when most high-risk residents have relocated, then more emphasis will be placed on medium-risk candidates. 
If high and medium-risk proactive relocation were to be incentivised simultaneously then that would lead to mass relocation, 
which this scheme is actively avoiding.

Figure 1 illustrates varying subsidy rate according to the value of the original property damaged by a catastrophic event:

Note that properties valued at Ꝕ1,500,000 or more make up approximately 1.12% (as shown in table below) of the housing market yet these residential properties ought to be accounted for by the scheme as catastrophic events affect the entire population regardless of socio-economic backgrounds. On the other hand, this program must be designed to alleviate the strain of financial losses on the economy, and the greatest losses impact individuals from low to mid socio-economic backgrounds. Hence, subsidies for proactive relocators with properties valued at Ꝕ1,500,000 or more are capped at 30% of Ꝕ1,500,000, or Ꝕ450,000, for high risk. 

Proportion of population based on property value:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113488523/230377605-eed9a288-3946-4930-9359-1d67b848dad3.png)  
<br> <ins> Claim requirements:  </ins> 
The government must verify whether the individual/family is currently and permanently residing in a high or medium-risk area (must supply proof of minimum one year within that locale). The events covered under this scheme, based on historical occurrences, are: 
  * Flooding
  * Cyclones
  * Hurricanes
  * Storms
  * Hail Damage
  * Lightning
  * Wildfire
  * Coastal Damage  

  1. Proactive relocators in high-risk areas:
   > - Must submit adequate proof of intention to relocate. I.e., proof of purchase of new property or lease, or any other official documentation stating the individual will be residing in a low-risk area in the foreseeable future.
   > - Must also provide proof of genuine urgency and motivation for relocating.  
  2. Proactive relocators in medium-risk areas:
  > - All individuals in high-risk areas must be processed before medium-risk claims can be assessed unless a catastrophic event has occurred in that area.
  > - Once budget is allocated for high-risk areas, the same procedure as (1) occurs for medium-risk areas. 
  3. Involuntary relocators in high and medium-risk areas:
  > - Must provide adequate proof that current property is uninhabitable after the catastrophic disaster occurs. A third party (I.e., a general insurer working with government initiatives) will also inspect the property to ensure this condition is met. 
  > - Claims will only be paid out once proof of purchase of new property or lease in a low-risk area is submitted. 


*Claims Processing Times:*  
Claims for proactive relocators in high-risk areas may take between 1-3 months to be processed. Claims for proactive relocators in medium-risk areas may take between 3-9 months to be processed, subject to the level of claims received in high-risk areas. Claims for involuntary relocators in both high and medium-risk areas affected by catastrophic events may take between 1-6 months, subject to how efficiently a third party will be able to assess the claims once the region is safe to access; immediately following a catastrophic event, there may be a high volume of claims being processed so there may be longer processing times. Generally, claims processed before a catastrophic event occurs will be processed more efficiently as the number of claims can be moderated. Furthermore, once the majority of the high-risk population embrace this scheme, relocation can be conducted in a methodical manner rather than in mass.  

Claims for individuals/families will only be paid once per lifetime. That is, married and de facto couples are only eligible for the new purchase of one new property together under this scheme. In addition, claims will be assessed and prioritised to provide immediate assistance to the worst-impacted property owners. Furthermore, individuals owning multiple properties (such as landlords) will only be able to make one claim for one property in a lifetime, regardless of whether it is an investment property or a personal home.  

<br> <ins> Limitations of coverage: </ins> 

| Limitation of coverage  |
|---|
|Businesses, both small and large, will not be covered by this scheme as there is not enough data provided indicating how businesses impact mass displacement risk.| 
| Individuals currently renting will not be eligible for benefits covered under this scheme.|
| Owner-occupied households and landlords of residential properties in low-risk areas are excluded from this scheme. The objective is to mitigate losses from mass displacement and individuals in low-risk areas do not have any other options for relocation other than emigrating from Storslysia, which is outside the scope of this scheme. Instead, we propose that the government introduce disaster relief payments to low risk areas that are not faced with the risk of mass displacement but still incur financial costs from property damage.|
| Individuals living in low-risk areas at any time during or after this scheme is implemented who choose to purchase a property in a high-risk area will automatically not qualify for this scheme. |
| Only individuals of legal age can apply for benefits under this scheme.|

This program aims to provide financial aid to the group of people who are at a higher risk of being displaced due to a mass event. The program will cover both owner-occupied households and landlords of residential properties who are legal adults and living in areas categorized as high or medium risk. The program will undergo yearly evaluations in the short-term to ensure it meets solvency requirements by analysing its annual costs and comparing them with the annual GDP figures. Additionally, the program will undergo a long-term evaluation every ten years to ensure its effectiveness and solvency as the impact of climate change worsens.

## Program Costs
<br> In this section, we compare the projected economic costs for Storslysia with and without the social insurance program in a short term (1 year) and long term (10 years) period. The projected costs incorporate inflation and climate change. Additionally, the economic cost with the program will need to satisfy the solvency requirement – not exceeding the 10% of the GDP each year, with a high degree of certainty.
<br> Each citizen would be provided with a letter notifying them of the risk level of the region in which they reside, documented in the table below:  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73229567/229707343-8925db29-b96b-47e3-9fa6-f442767bdbd7.png)   
Residents who live in regions 2 and 3 are given the priority to relocate in the event of a potential catastrophe. They are given a period of 3 months from the time of notification to relocate to a low-risk area (region 5 or 6). 

I) Storslysia costs to the Social Insurance Program:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73229567/229707687-082edcaa-bb74-4b42-934d-565252b1ab4a.png)
<br> The values above project the absolute maximum costs covered by the task force. That is, maximum costs to pay out to individuals under any conditions would be to enable 100% of high-risk populations to proactively relocate (at rates between 30-60%, in Figure 1), and for 100% of medium-risk population to be paid out as involuntary relocators (at rates between 20-50% as opposed to 10-30%). This is an overestimation of costs to ascertain with a high degree of certainty that the program will remain solvent. Note that historical costs in projections have been compounded to account for inflation; whilst inflation may not necessarily reflect the real property damage changes over time, there is greater certainty that the program remains solvent when overestimating the losses. 

<br> At a 95% confidence level, the total short-term costs to be paid out across all regions, which is the required economic capital required for this scheme to remain solvent for one year period, is Ꝕ1,217,365,372. For reference, this is just 0.0921% of the 2021 GDP. Thus, the scheme is guaranteed to remain solvent.

II) Storslysia costs to the individuals without the Social Insurance Program:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73229567/229708175-9b860eea-6fad-42ab-9619-3346fc7b6241.png)
<br> The values above estimate property damage costs to the residents, whereby models for severity  and frequency   of events were generated by fitting historical hazards data. Whilst the program costs under (I) overestimate the financial impact of the program, these costs under (II) provide a more realistic view of future catastrophic event impacts. Comparing (I) and (II) for regions 1 and 4 (medium-risk areas), (II) values are higher, which implies that in medium-risk areas we may expect the program to cover a large portion of relocation costs, however, it is unavoidable that individuals will also suffer some loss until subsidy rates for these regions are raised (as discussed in the program design). Comparing (I) and (II) for regions 2 and 3 (high-risk areas), (I) values are higher, which implies that costs paid out to these regions are overestimated compared with what the residents may realistically pay so, overall, this program will ensure a much smaller portion of costs will fall unto these high-risk residents. 

<br> <ins> Individual cost comparison with/without the program  </ins>
<br> Assume that everyone whose property (property value < Ꝕ300,000) is damaged will pay $H for housing. The material and labour costs will increase m% after weather events. The cost of replacing household goods takes g% of housing costs. (The detailed percentage coverage can be found in Figure1) 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73229567/229708757-1dfc13f9-2945-46b8-953e-12a02a1ae38a.png)

		 
## Program Assumptions
* The policyholders have full ownership of the land and buildings insured.
* Regions share common features such as agriculture, natural resources, and employment prospects.
* Within each region, the inherent risks are homogenous. I.e., For a high-risk region, we assume that all locales/districts within that region have the same risk profile.
* Relocation is not dependent on the population’s vocational background and all regions offer same employment.
* No additional cost associated with building on land other than the cost of housing itself. I.e., we assume no land tax is paid for individuals relocating.
*  Regions with higher revenue have better living standards, however, we assume that all regions will have an adequate standard of living, hence, this will not deter relocation.
* Renters do not face any difficulties seeking new leases and that individuals rebuilding homes should be able to secure a home loan after the benefit is paid.
* New house built by the individuals match the value of the original property.
* Individuals’ current property values indicate the financial standing of the individuals.
* Short term period is 1 year, and long-term period is 10 years.

<br>In estimating the overall cost under the program:
* The losses incurred due to property damages will be calculated based on two different assumptions: Negative Binomial distribution for the frequency of damages, and Gamma distribution for the severity (log of loss amount) of the damages. 
* The material and labour cost increase are randomly distributed from a uniform distribution of [0,50%]
* The overall cost of replacing household goods is randomly distributed from a uniform distribution of [40% ,75%] of housing costs.
* Took in the worst scenario where all households in the high-risk area will voluntarily relocate and all households in the medium are not willing to relocate. 
* In projecting the long-term program cost, we take the worst case into consideration. i.e., we are estimating under the worst climate condition.

## Sensitivity Analysis
<ins> Sensitivity against the percentage of people who are willing to voluntary relocate: </ins>

|Scenario | Definition|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Favourable| All population are not willing to relocate in the high-risk area, <br>All population are willing to relocate in the medium-risk area. |
| Average  | Half population are willing to relocate in the high-risk area, <br>Half population are willing to relocate in the medium-risk area.|
| Unfavourable   | All population are willing to relocate in the high-risk area, <br>All population are not willing to relocate in the medium-risk area.|

Assume that the cost for the program under favourable scenario is C.

|Scenarios |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  Favourable  | C  |
|  Average  | 1.2C  |
| Unfavourable | 1.35C |

<br>The program is less sensitive against the unfavourable scenario, which will be beneficial in face of adverse events to help the program remain solvent.

<br><ins> Sensitivity against the assumption for the percentage coverage: </ins>
* current coverafe : please refer to Figure 1
* Favourable Scenario : 20% decrease in the coverage 
* Unfavourable Scenario: 20% increase in the percentage coverage  

Assume that the cost for the program under current scenario is V.

|Scenarios| |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  Current | V  |
|  Favourable | 0.8V  |
| Unfavourable | 1.2V |

The program cost is linearly in relation to the percentage coverage, it leads to an easy estimation of the total cost when we are adjusting the program.


## Data and Data Limitations
Analyses for this program have utilized the following data sources supplied by the task force:
* Housing and demographic information
* Historical weather-related hazards data
* Economic data for Storslysia as a whole
* Projections of emissions scenarios with associated SSPs

The following data limitations were encountered:

|Property Damage Data | 
| ------------- |
| This was used to model housing costs however it is uncertain whether these property damage amounts related to residential properties only or whether it also encompassed commercial and public property. | 
| It is also uncertain whether property damage amounts related solely to the severity of the catastrophic event or whether it also related to density of populations. E.g., An equally severe event may result in greater damages to property in more dense areas compared to when populations are more scattered. |
