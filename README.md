## Executive Summary
The following report is addressed to Natalia Bowditch and Huey Caine’s task force. There is growing concern in the country of Storslysia that catastrophic weather events are becoming more prevalent. When these events occur in high-risk areas, the risk of mass permanent displacement is amplified, 
which puts a large strain on the country’s economy. Enclosed in this report are recommendations for the design of a social insurance program to mitigate financial losses arising from catastrophic climate-related displacement.
## Program Objectives
We have designed a program that minimises the cost of relocation (accounting for both voluntary relocation and involuntary displacement costs) to not exceed 10% of the country’s annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) with a high degree of certainty (1% significance level). This is achieved by 
incentivising proactive relocation from high-risk areas to low-medium risk areas before catastrophic events occur, as costs associated with proactive relocation are comparably lower than the costs associated with involuntary displacement following a catastrophic event. Furthermore, 
our design encompasses suggestions for deterring individuals from living in high-risk areas. 

Table 1 lists the indication of program success:

## Program Design
The program encompasses the proactive and reactive relocation of citizens and permanent residents owning residential properties of Storslysia. All citizens registered in the national census will be issued with a letter stating whether they are located within a low, medium, or high-risk area:

Proactive relocation areas of support (Appendix A) will also be provided through government agencies, however many of these are external to the program. These include, but are not limited to:

<br> <ins> Deterring involuntary displacement:</ins> </br> 
Consider two families that own properties valued at Ꝕ100,000. Family A are proactive relocators hence they will be able to purchase a home without having to replace any household items (40-75% of housing cost) nor will they be subjected to surges in labour and building costs (which are capped at 50% by law). 
However, Family B refuse to relocate, despite warnings of extreme weather events. 
The potential costs are:

Assuming individuals rebuild new properties of the same value as the original residence, involuntary displacement costs are 1.4-2.25 times greater than proactive relocation costs. To reflect the risk of (self-imposed) increased losses, the program will provide a subsidy of up to 50% of the original value of impacted
residential properties (Figure 1) in high and medium-risk areas, provided that relocation is necessary. This implies that involuntary relocators may face financial losses upwards of 90% upon rebuilding their new homes. Alternatively, should relocators choose to proactively migrate from a high to low-risk area, the program will subsidies the new property at a predetermined rate (Figure 1), 
which results in a much smaller financial loss to the individual; they will gain an extra benefit of 10% as well as avoiding additional costs from supply disruptions compared with involuntary relocation. Furthermore, this subsidised plan will be extended to individuals seeking to proactively relocate from medium to low-risk areas, however, 
the subsidised rate will only be up to 30% as the risk of being affected by a catastrophic event is lower. 
<br>No subsidy will be awarded to individuals in low-risk areas. The difference in subsidy rates between high-risk and medium-risk residencies is also set to priorities high-risk areas, 
which are at far greater risk of mass displacement and incur the greatest costs to the economy. Over time, these subsidy rates will be continually monitored and reassessed based on future cost projection as well as high-risk population projections; when most high-risk residents have relocated, then more emphasis will be placed on medium-risk candidates.
If high and medium-risk proactive relocation were to be incentivised simultaneously then that would lead to mass relocation, 
which this scheme is actively avoiding.
